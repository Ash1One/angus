# Genome assembly - challenge exercise.

Use the [MEGAHIT assembler](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012178)
to assemble the data set at `https://osf.io/frdz5/download`.  Then, run
the quast program on it to produce some summary metrics about your
assembly.

Questions:

* what is the read type for this data set?
* what is the approximate size of the assembled genome?
* what strategies would you use to figure out what species this genome
  is from?
