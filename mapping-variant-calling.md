# Mapping and variant calling on yeast transcriptome

Learning objectives:

* define and explore the concepts and implications of shotgun
  sequencing;
  
* explore coverage;

* understand the basics of mapping-based variant calling;

* learn basics of actually calling variants & visualizing.

## Boot up a Jetstream

You should still have your jetstream instance running, you can following the instructions [here](jetstream/boot.html) to log in to [JetStream](https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application/dashboard) and find your instance. Then `ssh` into it following the instructions [here](jetstream/boot.html#ssh-secure-login).

## Install software

```
conda install -y bwa samtools bcftools
```

## Change to a new working directory and map data
After installing the necessary software, we will create the working directory for the mapping as follows:

```
cd ~/
mkdir mapping
cd mapping
```

Next, we will create links from the previously downloaded and quality-trimmed yeast dataset:

```
ln -fs ~/quality/*.qc.fq.gz .
ls
```

## Variant Calling Workflow

<br>

## Map data

Goal: perform read alignment (also known as mapping) to determine where our reads originated from.

### Download and gunzip the reference:

Here we are going to align our transcripts to the reference's **open reading frames** to look for single-nucleotide variants. It's important to think about what reference is appropriate for your experiment. Many biologically important
variants exist in non-coding regions, so if we were looking at genomic sequences, it would be important to
use a different reference such as the whole genome.

```
curl -O https://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/orf_dna/orf_coding.fasta.gz
gunzip orf_coding.fasta.gz
```

Let's take a look at our reference:

```
head orf_coding.fasta
```

### Finding Help with bwa

To bring up the manual page for bwa we can type:

```
bwa
```

Notice that it brings up a description of the different commands within the `bwa` software. We will be using `index` and `mem`. 

We can also have a look at the [bwa options](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml) page. 


### Indexing: Prepare reference for mapping:

Our first step is to index the reference sequences for use by BWA. Indexing allows the aligner to quickly find potential
alignment sites for query sequences in a reference, which saves time during alignment. Indexing the reference only has to 
be run once. The only reason you would want to create a new index is if you are working with a different reference
or you are using a different tool for alignment.

```
bwa index orf_coding.fasta
```
        
### Mapping

We use an algorithm called `bwa mem` to perform mapping. To find more information via the help page for the `bwa mem` function we can type the command below. Without any input, the help page will come up by default:

```
bwa mem
```

Then, when we are ready perform mapping with our sample `ERR458493` we can type: 

```
bwa mem -t 4 orf_coding.fasta ERR458493.qc.fq.gz  > ERR458493.sam
```
While we are running bwa with the default parameters here, your use case might require a change of parameters. **NOTE:** Always read the manual page for any tool before using and make sure the options you use are appropriate for your data.

>
> - Standard alignment tools (Hisat2, STAR, BWA) try to find the read origin by FULL-ALIGNMENT of reads to a genome or transcriptome.
>
> - Ultra-fast alignment-free methods, such as Sailfish, **Salmon** and Kallisto, have been developed by exploiting the idea that precise alignments are not required to assign reads to their origins
>
> - Salmonâ€™s "quasi-mapping" approach uses **exact matching of k-mers (sub-strings in reads) to approximate which read a transcipt originated from.** The idea behind it being that it may not be important to exactly know where within a transcript a certain read originated from. Instead, it may be enough to **simply know which transcript the read represents.** 
>
> - Salmon therefore does not generate a BAM file because it does not worry about finding the best possible alignment. Instead, it yields a (probabilistic) measure of how many reads originated from each transcript. This is enough information for read quantification, and is really fast.
>
> - However, BWA `mem` produces an alignment, where an entire read is mapped exactly against a reference sequence. This produces more information that is important for things like variant calling. 

### Observe!


### SAM/BAM File formats

We can peek at our ".sam" file:

```
head ERR458493.sam
tail ERR458493.sam
```

The SAM file is a tab-delimited text file that contains information for each individual read and its 
alignment to the reference. While we do not have time to go in detail of the features of the SAM format, 
the paper by [Heng Li et al.](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/16/2078.full) provides a lot more detail on the specification.

The compressed binary version of SAM is called a BAM file. We use this version to reduce size and to 
allow for indexing, which enables efficient random access of the data contained within the file.

<blockquote>

Using the <code>bwa</code> command we ran above as the foundation, construct a <i>for loop</i> to generate ".sam" alignment files for all of our quality controlled samples!

## Visualize mapping

Goal: make it possible to vizualize some of our mapping results.

### Index the reference:

Before we indexed the reference for BWA, now we need to index the reference for samtools. To see the manual for `samtools` we can type:

```
samtools
```

Although both tools use different indexing methods, they both allow the tools to find specific sequences within
the reference quickly. We can see that an indexing function is `samtools faidx`.

```
samtools faidx orf_coding.fasta
```
        
### Convert the SAM file into a BAM file:

Next, we will convert our file format to a `.bam` file with the `samtools view` command. Let's see the different parameters for this function:

```
samtools view
```
We can see that:

- `-S`: ignored (input format is auto-detected)
- `-b`: output BAM

So let's convert our file format for sample `ERR458493`:

```
samtools view -S -b ERR458493.sam > ERR458493.bam
```
        
### Sort the BAM file by position in genome:

You can sort on many different columns within a sam or bam file. After mapping, our
files are sorted by read number. Most programs require mapping files to be sorted by
position in the reference. You can sort a file using the `samtools sort` command.

```
samtools sort ERR458493.bam -o ERR458493.sorted.bam
```
        
### Index the BAM file so that we can randomly access it quickly:

```
samtools index ERR458493.sorted.bam
```

### Call variants with `bcftools`!

**Goal:** find places where the reads are systematically different from the
reference.

A variant call is a conclusion that there is a nucleotide difference vs. some reference at a given 
position in an individual genome or transcriptome, often referred to as a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (**SNP**). 
The call is usually accompanied by an estimate of variant frequency and some measure of confidence. Similar 
to other steps in this workflow, there are number of tools available for variant calling. In this workshop 
we will be using `bcftools`, but there are a few things we need to do before actually calling the variants.

First, let's look at the manual page for `bcftools`, making note of the `mpileup` and `call` commands:

```
bcftools
```

Let's see the different parameters for the `bcftools mpileup` command by typing:

```
bcftools mpileup
```

**Note:** The parameters we will use for `bcftools mpileup` are:  
- `-O`:  Output file type, which can be:  
    - 'b' **compressed BCF. We will use this output format!**
    - 'u' uncompressed BCF 
    - 'z' compressed VCF
    - 'v' uncompressed VCF
- `-f`: faidx indexed reference sequence file

And to find help for the `bcftools call` function: 

```
bcftools call
```

**Note:** The parameters for `bcftools call` that we will use:  
- `-m`: alternative model for multiallelic and rare-variant calling (conflicts with -c)  
- `-v`: output variant sites only
- `-o`: write output to a file 

Now, let's go ahead and run our command on our sample `ERR458493`! 

```
bcftools mpileup -O b -f orf_coding.fasta ERR458493.sorted.bam | \
    bcftools call -m -v -o variants.vcf
```

Next, we will use a perl script from `samtools` called `vcfutils.pl` that will filter out our variants and 
we can write the output to a new file.  

```
vcfutils.pl varFilter variants.vcf  > variants_filtered.vcf
```


To look at the entire `variants.vcf` file you can do `cat
variants.vcf`; all of the lines starting with `#` are comments.  You
can use `tail variants.vcf` to see the last ~10 lines, which should
be all of the called variants.

The first few columns of the VCF file represent the information we have about a predicted variation:

| column | info |
| ------ | ------ | 
| CHROM |	contig location where the variation occurs |
| POS |	position within the contig where the variation occurs |
| ID |	a `.` until we add annotation information |
| REF |	reference genotype (forward strand) |
| ALT |	sample genotype (forward strand) |
| QUAL |	Phred-scaled probablity that the observed variant exists at this site (higher is better) |
| FILTER |	a `.` if no quality filters have been applied, PASS if a filter is passed, or the name of the filters this variant failed |

The Broad Instituteâ€™s [VCF guide](https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/article?id=1268) is an excellent place to learn more about VCF file format.

        
### Visualize with `tview`:

Now that we know the locations of our variants, let's view them with `samtools`!

Samtools implements a very simple text alignment viewer called tview. 
This alignment viewer works with short indels and shows MAQ consensus. It uses different colors to display 
mapping quality or base quality, subjected to users' choice. Samtools viewer is known to work with an 
130 GB alignment swiftly. Due to its text interface, displaying alignments over network is also very fast.

In order to visualize our mapped reads we use tview, giving it the sorted bam file and the reference file:

```
samtools tview ERR458493.sorted.bam orf_coding.fasta
```
        
   `tview` commands of relevance:
   
   * left and right arrows scroll
   * `q` to quit
   * CTRL-h and CTRL-l do "big" scrolls
   * Typing `g` allows you to go to a specific location, in this format chromosome:location. Here are some locations you can try out:
   
     - `YLR162W:293` (impressive pileup, shows two clear variants and three other less clear)
     - `YDR034C-A:98` (impressive pileup, shows two clear variants)
     - `YDR366C:310` (impressive pileup, less clear variants)
     - `YLR256W:4420` (impressive pileup, less clear variants)
     - `YBL105C:2179` (less depth, shows two clear variants)
     - `YDR471W:152` (impressive pileup, shows one clear variant)
   
Get some summary statistics as well:

```
samtools flagstat ERR458493.sorted.bam
```
