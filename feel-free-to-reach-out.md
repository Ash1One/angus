### Betsy Alford
- My research primarily focuses on the co-evolution between plants and microbes.  I have experience in amplicon analysis, metagenomics, genome assembly, and cross kingdom analysis. I regularly script in bash and python and have a working knowledge in R.

### [Chissa Rivaldi](https://twitter.com/powerofcheez)
- I am rooted in population/landscape genetics, parasite, and amplicon sequencing studies. I script in bash, python, and R, and increasingly automation flows like snakemake.

### [Marian L. Schmidt](https://marschmi.github.io/marschmi.github.io/)  
- My research focuses on the ecology & evolution of aquatic bacterial communities. Specifically, I'm interested in the drivers of community composition and the controls on bacterial genome size. I have experience (& am happy to help others!) with 16S rRNA amplicon data sets and recovering & refining genomes from complex metagenomic sequencing data sets.
