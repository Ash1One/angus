### [Marian L. Schmidt](https://marschmi.github.io/marschmi.github.io/)  
- My research focuses on how the environment influencces bacterial community composition and the evolution of aquatic bacterial communities. I have experience with (and am happy to help others) with 16S rDNA data amplicon data sets and recovering genomes from complex metagenomic data.
