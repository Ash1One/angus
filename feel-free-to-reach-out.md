### [Marian L. Schmidt](https://marschmi.github.io/marschmi.github.io/)  
- I'm a Michigander who has transplanted myself into Austin, TX. My research focuses on the ecology & evolution of bacterial communities that live within aquatic ecosystems. Specifically, I'm interested in how the environment and community interactions influence bacterial genome size & genome characteristics. I am happy to help with and have experience with 16S rDNA data amplicon data sets and recovering genomes from complex metagenomic data.
