## slack

* slack is a way to do realtime passing around of notes / info during class

* it is also a good way to arrange/coordinate social activities; works on phones, etc.

* we will have room specific channels, as well as #general for course wide stuff and #random for fun.

* room specific channels can be used for questions during the presentation (instead of / in addition to asking for help)

* also have a #social channel, and maybe others; go ahead and invite.

## hackmd:

* hackmd is a good way to do collaborative note taking
* will have one hackmd per room
* they will be persistent
* you are welcome to join us in taking notes! ask a TA or helper on how to connect in to edit instead of view

## e-mail:

We are using the [groups.io](https://dibsi18.groups.io/g/main)
platform for e-mail.  The list will generally only be used for
important updates and announcements of schedule changes
