# Cloud Resources

## XSEDE Jetstream

Jetstream is an NSF-funded (NSF-1445604), user-friendly cloud environment designed to give researchers access to interactive computing and data analysis resources on demand, whenever and wherever they want to analyze their data.

Jetstream provides a library of virtual machines pre-configured to support scientific analysis and collaboration in a variety disciplines (for example, biology, earth sciences, and social sciences, among others). Generic Linux-based VM configurations also are available, allowing software developers and researchers to create their own custom VMs to support specific applications or disciplines. 

The XSEDE user portal allows users to manage their accounts and request for allocations in a single interface.

### XSEDE Allocation types

The XSEDE allocations process defines three types of projects.

+ **Startup:** Startup projects target new users planning to submit more substantial requests in the future as well as users who have modest computational requirements that, nevertheless, cannot be satisfied by their campus resources.

+ **Education:** Education projects target faculty or teachers intending to use XSEDE-allocated resources for classroom instruction or training classes related to the use of advanced cyberinfrastructure technologies.

+ **Research:** Research projects are designated for projects that have progressed beyond the startup phase and are conducting production usage of XSEDE-allocated resources in pursuit of their research objectives.


#### Example proposals

- Example Genetics startup [proposal](https://portal.xsede.org/documents/10308/29438/Successful+Startup+Request1.pdf)

- Example Volcanology startup [request](https://portal.xsede.org/documents/10308/29438/Successful+Startup+Request2.pdf)

### Campus Champion Allocations

- Nearly 200 campuses across the country have designated "Campus Champions" to facilitate and support use of XSEDE-allocated resources by researchers, educators, and students on their campuses. Most Campus Champions have established projects on XSEDE resources, which campus users can access to evaluate systems, conduct benchmark runs, or carry out small-scale research projects.

- Contact [your Campus Champion](https://www.xsede.org/web/guest/current-champions) for fast and easy access to XSEDE-allocated resources or to get help submitting your own allocation request.

- Please consult the [Campus Champions page](https://www.xsede.org/campus-champions) for more on the program.

## CyVerse Cyber-infrastructure

> **CyVerse Mission:** Design, deploy, and expand a national cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research and train scientists in its use. CyVerse provides life scientists with powerful computational infrastructure to handle huge datasets and complex analyses, thus enabling data-driven discovery. Our powerful extensible platforms provide data storage, bioinformatics tools, image analyses, cloud services, APIs, and more.


The CyVerse user portal allows users to manage their accounts, subscriptions and events in a single place. 

- **[CyVerse User Portal](https://user.cyverse.org/)**

**Note: Some CyVerse services (such as Atmosphere) have additional restrictions and access must be ‘turned on’. To create an account on CyVerse & under services available "Request Atmosphere Access" for access to on-demand cloud computing.**

### Data Store

+ Upload, download and share your data
+ Data limit of 100 GB (can request increase up to 10 TB)
+ Data storage is integrated into the Discovery Environment (where analyses are run).
+ Share your data with collaborators
+ **[Data Store Guide & Documentation](https://cyverse-data-store-guide.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/)**


### Atmosphere

Create a custom cloud-based scientific analysis platform or use a ready-made one for your area of scientific interest.

+ Cloud computing for life sciences
+ 100s of pre-built images
+ Fully customize your software setup
+ Choose (or build) an image that best suits your needs
+ **[Atmosphere guide](https://cyverse-atmosphere-guide.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/)**
